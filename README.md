# Barrie Library - A Book Search Application using JavaFx
### Java Assignment - 2


## Challenges Faced
> In this assignment I was challenged with finding an API and implementing a scene that utilizes the API to display information with JavaFx.
The most difficult part of this assignment was parsing the data retrieved from Open Library's API, as the initial search gives additional data which references other editions, it was difficult to find what edition number was for the specific book object.

## Solution to Challenge
> The solution to the above problem faced were to use the seed ID of the book and make another API Call to get the data inlined with the searched book as it appeared on Open Library.

## Ways I can improve this project
> 1. Improve my Class validations, which would allow me to refactor a lot of code that performs checks.

## Knowledge Obtain from this Project
> 1. From this project I had learn to enable the HTTP client and make API calls 
> 2. I had learn to pass data between scenes. 
> 3. I learned how to utilize Threading in Java and JavaFx, which is used to load book covers and the related books sections.
> 4. To store the JSON result to a file and to parse it as a class using GSON.


### Technologies Used
The technologies used to build this application were, (Java, JavaFx, GSON, Scene Builder and CSS)
